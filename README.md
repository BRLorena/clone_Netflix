This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.4.<br><br>


# üíª Functionalities

This is a project I started to carry out that is a clone of the Netflix APP. In it I separated the main page into components.
The main component "app.component.ts" created an array of objects where I added the titles with their respective parameters. <br><br>

## Implementations

‚úîÔ∏è In the nav-bar knowledge of the "ngClass" directive was used, which allows to define a class dynamically from the <strong> DOM </strong> of the element, in this case the <b> {'sidebar-open'} </b>presented in my view <b>(nav-bar.component.html).</b><br>

‚úîÔ∏è To create the list of titles presented, first I made an Input of the list and titles that I had created in my <b>"app.component".</b> After that, it was inserted in my view dynamically using <b>"ngFor".</b><br>

‚úîÔ∏è In title they were where I had more work. First I made a call through the <b>property viewChid</b> to be able to implement the <b>'trailer'</b> which is a parameter of the <b>'listTitles'object,</b> after that I passed the <b> property 'trailer:'</b>  receives the <b> class ElementRef</b>  and inside I passed an interface element to the <b> HTMLVideoElement</b>  that allowed me manipulate video objects.<br>
That done I added the functions of <b> play, stop, mute and toggle.</b> <br><br>
